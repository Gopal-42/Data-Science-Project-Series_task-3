# Sentiment Analysis
# Author: Gopal Krishna 
# Batch: July
# Domain: DATA SCIENCE 

## Aim
The aim of this project is to build a predictive model capable of determining whether a given text conveys positive, negative, or neutral sentiment using machine learning techniques.

## Libraries
-Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
-NumPy: Numerical computing.
-Matplotlib: Data visualization.
-Seaborn: Statistical data visualization.
-NLTK: Natural Language Toolkit for text preprocessing.
-Scikit-learn: Machine learning library.
-LIME: Model interpretability.
-Flask: Web framework for deployment.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle. It contains text data labeled with sentiment categories (positive, negative, neutral).

## Data Preprocessing
-Lowercasing: Convert all text to lowercase.
-Removing Stop Words: Eliminate common words that do not contribute to sentiment.
-Handling Special Characters: Remove or replace special characters.
-Tokenization and Lemmatization: Break text into tokens and reduce words to their base form.

## Model Selection
1.Text Vectorization: Convert text to numerical vectors using TF-IDF.
2.Model Training: Train models like Naive Bayes and SVM.
3.Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters using GridSearchCV.
4.Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the process of building a sentiment analysis model, from data preprocessing to model evaluation. The chosen models and techniques provide a robust framework for classifying text data based on sentiment, with potential applications in various domains such as customer feedback analysis and social media monitoring.
